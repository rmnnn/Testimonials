## My process

- I launched design files and introduced myself into the whole concept
- After I introduced myself, I started with plain HTML
- Just after HTML data I started with CSS and finished work there

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I made good experience using css grid while working on this project. It just gives you some space to think about how to set up all things and makes your creativity better.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, auto);
  gap: 25px;
}
```
